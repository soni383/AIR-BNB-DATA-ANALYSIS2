Airbnb depends heavily on Online & Offline Travel Agents, but boosting direct bookings could increase profitability.

Prime location properties are underperforming despite higher earning potential → require targeted marketing.

Europe & North America dominate bookings, while Asia and Africa offer growth opportunities.

Customers generally book early (1–2 months), enabling strategic promotions in advance.

Cancellations are minimal, showing guest commitment.

High customer engagement via reviews strengthens brand credibility and can be leveraged for marketing.

📌 Next Steps

Increase Direct Bookings: Reduce dependency on OTAs by offering discounts or loyalty rewards for direct reservations.

Boost Prime Location Listings: Improve visibility and pricing strategy to attract higher bookings in prime areas.

Expand in Asian Markets: Marketing efforts in Asia could diversify revenue streams.

Optimize Lead Time Strategy: Since customers book ~45 days early, targeted campaigns can be launched 1–2 months ahead of peak seasons.
